### Ruby on Rails Maintenance Cost: The Money-Burning Problem

If you've ever asked "how much does it cost to maintain my Rails app?" you've probably noticed that no one gives you a straight answer. And for good reason.

The cost of a giant, once-every-5-years upgrade is like planning a family vacation by spinning a globe and booking the first flight you see. It's expensive, unpredictable, and usually comes with a headache.

We've seen companies burn six figures trying to jump from Rails 5 to Rails 7 in one go. By the time they’re done, they could have funded an in-house developer… or bought a Tesla.

### Why Incremental Upgrades Are the Better Bet

Here's the thing: Rails, like your teeth, is easier to maintain if you don't wait five years to see the dentist. Small, regular checkups prevent the giant bill and the painful root canal.

That's why incremental upgrades are the best practice. Move from Rails 6.0 to 6.1, not 6.0 to 7.1 in a panic. Smaller steps mean fewer broken gems, less downtime, and no all-nighters for your dev team.

### Rails Fever’s Rails Care Plan: Transparent, Not Scary

At Rails Fever, we got tired of watching companies burn money on surprise upgrades. So we built our Rails Care Plan around transparent pricing and proactive maintenance.

Here’s how it breaks down:

* **Foundation – $5,000/month**
    For small apps (up to 20k LOC) on Heroku, Render, or Hatchbox. Includes monthly patches, one major Rails upgrade per year, monitoring, and reports. Think of it as your Rails dental cleaning plan.

* **Growth – $10,000/month (Most Popular)**
    For mid-sized apps with custom infra on AWS/GCP/DO (up to 60k LOC). Adds roadmap tracking, pipeline support, and strategy calls. Optional weekend emergency support if you like living dangerously.

* **Partner – $20,000/month**
    For apps so mission-critical that downtime isn’t just expensive—it’s unthinkable. Includes full DevOps, CTO-level advisory, and premium SLAs. Basically “Rails maintenance on steroids.”

And every plan starts with a 3-month trial. Because unlike that shady car mechanic, we actually want you to trust us before signing a long-term deal.

### The Bottom Line

Rails maintenance cost is about more than dollars—it’s about predictability. You can either:

1. Wait 5 years, roll the dice, and pray your upgrade doesn’t explode your budget.

1. Or sign up for a [Rails Care Plan](/services/rails_care_plan/), spend a predictable monthly fee, and never worry about surprise six-figure upgrades again.

Your call. But we recommend _keeping your budget out of the bonfire_ ™.
