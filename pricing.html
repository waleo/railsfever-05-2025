      <h2>🤔 Still Deciding? Here's Why SaaS Teams Choose Rails Fever</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Choosing a long-term maintenance partner is a big decision — especially when your app is core to your business. Here's what sets Rails Fever apart:</p>

      <div class="differentiators">
        <div class="differentiator">
          <div class="diff-icon">💡</div>
          <h3>Transparent Pricing That Reflects Your App's Complexity</h3>
          <p>Most dev agencies don't publish pricing — and when they do, it's vague or hourly.</p>
          <p>At Rails Fever, our pricing is clear and based on <strong>objective criteria</strong> like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lines of code</strong> (LOC)</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment complexity</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Support expectations</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>You'll know exactly what you're paying and why. No surprises. No bloated retainers. <strong>Just predictable, business-aligned pricing.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <div class="diff-icon">🔧</div>
          <h3>Not Just Maintenance — Actual Support</h3>
          <p>We're not just running <code>bundle update</code> and sending you a report.</p>
          <p><strong>We provide:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-world support</strong> when something goes wrong</li>
            <li><strong>Bug fixes and code improvements</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Emergency response coverage</strong> with weekend SLA add-ons</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our incentive is the same as yours: fewer incidents. So we naturally invest in hardening your app, fixing brittle areas, and proactively monitoring risk.</p>
          <p class="highlight">We don't just maintain your Rails app — we make it stronger over time.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="diff-icon">👷</div>
          <h3>Senior Engineering, No Junior Hand-Offs</h3>
          <p>Rails Fever is led by a senior engineer with over 25 years of experience. You won't get passed to a junior dev after the sale. We handle:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Legacy systems</strong> with care</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade paths</strong> with real-world constraints</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> across Heroku, AWS, and custom stacks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We specialize in Rails. We live and breathe it. You won't have to explain what's behind that 500 error — we already have your logs and alerts set up before you even email us.</p>

          <h3>Designed for Teams <em>Without</em> In-House Devs</h3>
          <p>If you're a SaaS company without a dedicated development team, Rails Fever is built for you.</p>
          <p>We don't just patch code — we act like your <strong>fractional rails team</strong>, giving you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical stability</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Strategic input</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Developer-level confidence</strong> without full-time dev overhead</li>
