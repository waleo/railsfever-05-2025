  <section class="problem-section">
    <h2>Senior-Led Feature Development for Growing SaaS Products</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">Building features is easy in theory. Shipping them reliably in production is not.</p>
    <p class="section-description">As your SaaS grows, feature development becomes slower, riskier, and more expensive. Internal engineers get overloaded. Founders become bottlenecks. Roadmaps stall.</p>
    <p class="section-highlight">Rails Fever provides senior-level Rails feature development so you can keep shipping without chaos.</p>
