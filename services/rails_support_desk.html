          How do I know which tier my incident falls into?
          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>After a quick intake call, we'll tell you whether it's Minor ($3K), Major ($6K), or Critical ($12K). Most emergencies fall into the Major tier. You'll know the cost upfront — no surprises.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">

          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Flat-rate pricing means we stay on it until the system is stable, even if it takes longer than usual. We don't bill by the hour.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We guarantee <strong>dedicated emergency response</strong> and will get your Rails app back online or stable. In rare cases where an underlying third-party service is at fault (e.g. AWS outage), we'll stabilize your system as much as possible and provide workarounds until the provider resolves the issue.</p>

          <p>Yes. We'll walk you through granting secure, temporary access (GitHub, hosting, database). Everything is kept confidential and removed once the incident is resolved.</p>
